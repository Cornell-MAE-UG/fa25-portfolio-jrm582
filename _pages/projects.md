For this project, I designed a lifting mechanism within a 150 cm × 50 cm 2D design space using a rigid bar, three pin supports, and an  actuator. My objective was to lift the maximum possible payload to the greatest height while respecting geometric and support constraints. I selected the RSA actuator, which provides up to 58 kN of force, and placed two pin supports on the ground with a third support on the moving linkage. I modeled the bar as a rigid body and performed a static force analysis to determine the optimal actuator mounting angle and bar geometry so that the actuator force would be converted efficiently into vertical lift. After determining the configuration that maximized vertical displacement while maintaining equilibrium, I created a final sketch of the mechanism showing the bar, supports, and actuator arrangement.

In the second phase, the bar was treated as a flexible beam subjected to transverse forces from both the payload and actuator. I computed the maximum beam deflection and compared it to the design limit of 2% of the beam length. I then selected an efficient beam cross-section and material that minimized mass while keeping deflection within allowable limits. Finally, I produced an updated drawing showing the beam with its chosen cross-section in the completed lifting mechanism.
