## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/ProfilePicture.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a sophomore Materials Science and Engineering student at Cornell University. I have an unwavering desire to better this world and believe I can help the most amount of people through science and doing research. I hope to be at the forefront of new innovations in fields like nanoscience and nuclear fusion. I also more recently discovered my passion for music production and in my free time have started to make my own music with the hope that I can eventually grow that into something I can effect change through as well. I used to be a mid-distance track runner but due to repeated stress injuries I only run for fun now.
